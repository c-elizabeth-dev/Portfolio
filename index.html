        <div class="about-me-content">
            <p>
                My journey to a fulfilling career in software development has been marked 
                by determination, a can-do attitude, and a desire to learn. I embarked on a 
                transformative 12-week intensive bootcamp at Just IT Training Ltd, 
                where I delved into both front-end and back-end development. 
                <br>
                Throughout my career, including my time in retail and customer service, I've 
                excelled in building strong rapport and lasting relationships with clients, 
                other business owners and stakeholders. 
                <br>
                As I work towards a future as a junior software developer, 
                I intend to leverage my creative eye, proficient graphic design skills, and 
                strong knowledge of Photoshop, Procreate, and other design tools, alongside my 
                more analytical side. My ability to connect with people, solve problems efficiently, 
                and embrace new learning challenges positions me to thrive in this exciting transition, 
                where I am enthusiastic about the opportunities and experiences that lie ahead.

            <br>
            <p>
                In my personal life I enjoy painting... I'm no Van Gogh but I've had a few commission requests!
                I also run a freelance homeware design brand in my free time, mostly designing and making very snazzy cushions.
                <br><br>
                I enjoy days out rather than nights out, love a good action movie (John Wick tops the list for me!) and will coo at any dog I meet.
                <br> <br>
                I feel I have achieved many great things in life but no accomplishment will ever top the feeling of receiving my 5 metre swim certificate as a kid!

            <p>
                Since the start of my course with JustIT I have delved into learning the foundations of HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, MYSQL and PYTHON. In my own time I have 
                become familiar with the use of GitHub which is a brilliant and essential tool in software development.
                I have used Flask - as a you can see in my projects - to present a Python film app I created and will be spending time on gaining a deeper knowledge on this framework.
                <br><br>
                I will also be dedicating the next few months to build on my use of REACT.JS and researching which other tools and frameworks I feel would complement my work.

            <h4>Film App</h4>

            <p class="clicktoview">Click Image to see app</p>
            <p>
                With the use of Python, MYSQL, HTML, CSS and the framework Flask I created a film app linked to a database of films.
                This exercise required me to connect to a database, create new records, update said records, read the records and delete
                specific records if required. I initally created this app using purely Python and MYSQL (SQLITE) but wanted to challenge
                myself in using a framework I had yet to learn. Flask intrigues me and I would like to take this app to the next level
                by incorporating imagery, blurbs and a login/registration ability that acknowledges if the user has admin access and therefore
                the abilty to modify the database.

                <p>Using HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT, I created a productivity helper app. The app contains a functional calculator, calendar, a to do list
                    where the user can check off and delete tasks and a budget tracker with local storage implemented.
                    To improve this project in the future I am working on gaining a good understanding of working with Flask and perhaps implementing
                    a user log in and database.

                <p>Using HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT, I successfully aesthetically cloned a well known jewellery website. This project was completed in week 3
                    of my course and I have since improved my work flow and responsive design. I found with this project, starting with the desktop layout
                    led to difficulties at the time in making it responsive on mobile. I am very pleased with the end result on desktop and it has since 
                    helped me learn the importance of a thought out work flow. I now approach most projects with a mobile first approach which has improved my web design.

                    Using HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT I created a simple, fun tic tac toe game. A classic! I enjoyed implementing my knowledge into something that is purely
                    focussed on entertainment. I am excited to see what more I can do in this area and gather the skills required to create more detailed games.
